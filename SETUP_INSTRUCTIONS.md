# 🚀 Novu Workflow Setup Instructions

I've created 3 easy-to-use text files with all the workflow templates ready to copy/paste into Novu.

## 📁 Files Created:
- `workflow-1-appointment-confirmation.txt`
- `workflow-2-booking-reminder.txt` 
- `workflow-3-payment-confirmation.txt`

## 🎯 Quick Setup Process:

### Step 1: Open the Files
1. Open `workflow-1-appointment-confirmation.txt` 
2. Go to https://web.novu.co in your browser
3. Sign in to your Novu account

### Step 2: Create Each Workflow
For each workflow file:

1. **Go to**: Workflows → Create Workflow
2. **Copy Basic Info** from the txt file:
   - Name
   - Identifier  
   - Description
3. **Add 3 Steps**:
   - **Email Step**: Copy/paste the HTML content
   - **SMS Step**: Copy/paste the SMS message
   - **In-App Step**: Copy/paste subject & body
4. **Save** the workflow
5. **Repeat** for the next txt file

### Step 3: Test Everything
After creating all 3 workflows, run in terminal:
```bash
node test-novu-workflows.js
```

You should see ✅ success messages instead of "workflow_not_found" errors.

## ⏱️ Total Time: 10-15 minutes
- ~5 minutes per workflow
- All templates are ready to copy/paste
- No typing required!

## 🎉 What You Get:
- ✅ Professional email templates with barbershop branding
- ✅ Multi-channel notifications (Email + SMS + In-App)
- ✅ Full integration with your existing booking system
- ✅ Revenue-ready notification platform

## 💡 Pro Tips:
- Keep the txt files open while working in Novu
- Copy/paste exactly - don't modify the templates
- Make sure to use the exact identifiers (appointment-confirmation, etc.)
- Test each workflow as you create it

## ❓ Need Help?
If anything doesn't work:
1. Double-check the identifiers match exactly
2. Make sure all 3 steps are added to each workflow
3. Verify you're signed into the correct Novu account
4. Run the test command to verify deployment

The integration code is 100% complete and waiting - we just need the workflows deployed in Novu!
