    # 2. Retrieve contextual insights from vector DB
    contextual_insights = await vector_knowledge_service.get_contextual_insights(message)
    
    # 3. Select optimal AI provider
    provider = select_optimal_provider(message, message_type)
    
    # 4. Enhance context with RAG insights
    enhanced_context = {**business_context, 'contextual_insights': contextual_insights}
    
    # 5. Generate AI response with enhanced context
    response = await chat_with_provider(provider, messages, enhanced_context)
    
    # 6. Store interaction as knowledge for future learning
    await store_interaction_knowledge(message, response, message_type)
    
    return response
