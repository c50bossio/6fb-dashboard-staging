### 📋 Deployment Steps

#### 1. Final Code Review
- [ ] Verify all useEffect dependencies are complete
- [ ] Check for any console.log statements to remove
- [ ] Ensure error handling is comprehensive
- [ ] Validate TypeScript types if applicable

#### 2. Build Verification
```bash
npm run lint        # Must pass
npm run build       # Must generate 300+ pages
npm run test:all    # Must pass all tests
```

#### 3. Environment Variables
Ensure production has:
- [ ] NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
- [ ] NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
- [ ] SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY (backend only)
- [ ] STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
- [ ] NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY

#### 4. Database Migration
- [ ] Verify production database schema matches development
- [ ] Ensure RLS policies are configured correctly
- [ ] Check indexes on frequently queried columns

#### 5. Testing in Production
- [ ] Login as a BARBER user
- [ ] Navigate to /shop/products
- [ ] Add product to cart
- [ ] Verify barber auto-selects at checkout
- [ ] Complete a transaction
- [ ] Verify commission is recorded

### 🎯 Key Features to Test

#### Barber Auto-Selection Flow
1. **With Appointment**: Customer with existing booking should auto-select their assigned barber
2. **Logged-in Barber**: Barber processing their own checkout auto-selects themselves
3. **Manual Fallback**: Shows dropdown when no auto-selection criteria met

#### Commission Tracking
- Transaction creates commission_transactions record
- Barber balance updates in barber_commission_balances
- 60/40 split calculated correctly
- Status set to 'pending_payout'

#### Mobile Experience
- Checkout modal uses full screen on tablets
- Touch targets are 48px minimum
- Responsive breakpoints work correctly
- No text overflow on smaller screens

### 📊 Success Metrics

Post-deployment, monitor:
- [ ] Auto-selection success rate > 80%
- [ ] Commission calculation accuracy = 100%
- [ ] Mobile checkout completion rate > 70%
- [ ] No infinite loop errors in production
- [ ] Page load time < 3 seconds

### 🚨 Rollback Plan

If issues arise:
1. Revert to previous deployment
2. Check error logs in Supabase/Vercel
3. Verify environment variables
4. Test with development database first
5. Re-deploy with fixes

### 📝 Post-Deployment Notes

- Monitor Sentry/error tracking for first 24 hours
- Check commission calculations daily for first week
- Gather barber feedback on auto-selection accuracy
- Track mobile vs desktop checkout success rates
