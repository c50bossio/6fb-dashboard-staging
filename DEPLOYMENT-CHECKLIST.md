# üöÄ Production Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Verification ‚úÖ

### 1. Environment Variables
- [ ] Copy `.env.production.template` to `.env.production`
- [ ] Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` (from Supabase dashboard)
- [ ] Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (from Supabase dashboard)
- [ ] Set `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (from Supabase dashboard)
- [ ] Set AI API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)
- [ ] Set Stripe keys for payments
- [ ] Set email/SMS service keys (SendGrid, Twilio)

### 2. Supabase Configuration
- [ ] Enable Row Level Security on all tables
- [ ] Verify RLS policies are active
- [ ] Check database connection pooling is enabled
- [ ] Confirm authentication providers are configured
- [ ] Test Google OAuth in production settings

### 3. Build Verification
```bash
# Run these commands before deploying
npm run lint          # Should pass with warnings only
npm run build         # Should generate 220+ static pages
npm run test:basic    # Basic tests should pass
```

### 4. Security Checklist (Simplified)
- [ ] ‚úÖ Using Supabase authentication (JWT tokens)
- [ ] ‚úÖ RLS policies enabled on all tables
- [ ] ‚úÖ HTTPS enforced (handled by hosting provider)
- [ ] ‚úÖ Stripe handling payment security
- [ ] ‚ùå NO CSRF tokens (intentionally removed - see SECURITY-GUIDELINES.md)
- [ ] ‚ùå NO complex CSP headers (they break OAuth)

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Vercel (Recommended for Next.js)

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod

# Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard
# https://vercel.com/dashboard/[your-project]/settings/environment-variables
```

**Pros:**
- Automatic HTTPS
- Global CDN for static pages
- Automatic deployments from GitHub
- Built for Next.js

### Option 2: Railway

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm i -g @railway/cli

# Login and initialize
railway login
railway init

# Deploy
railway up

# Set environment variables
railway variables set KEY=value
```

**Pros:**
- Includes database hosting
- Simple deployment process
- Good for full-stack apps

### Option 3: Docker + Cloud Provider

```bash
# Build Docker image
docker build -t barbershop-app .

# Run locally to test
docker-compose up

# Deploy to cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure)
# See provider-specific instructions
```

## Post-Deployment Checklist

### Immediate Verification (First 5 Minutes)
- [ ] Homepage loads without errors
- [ ] Login with email/password works
- [ ] Google OAuth authentication works
- [ ] Database connection confirmed (check Supabase dashboard)
- [ ] No CSRF token errors in console

### Functional Testing (First Hour)
- [ ] Create a test booking
- [ ] Test payment flow with Stripe test card (4242 4242 4242 4242)
- [ ] Verify email notifications sent
- [ ] Check barber dashboard loads
- [ ] Test customer search functionality
- [ ] Verify AI chat features work

### Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Check Vercel/Railway logs for errors
- [ ] Monitor Supabase dashboard for database errors
- [ ] Set up uptime monitoring (UptimeRobot, Pingdom)
- [ ] Configure error alerts (email/Slack)

## Common Deployment Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "CSRF token mismatch"
**Solution:** This should not happen anymore. If it does, check that CSRF code wasn't accidentally re-added.

### Issue: "Cannot connect to Supabase"
**Solution:** 
1. Verify environment variables are set correctly
2. Check Supabase project is not paused
3. Confirm service role key is correct

### Issue: "OAuth redirect mismatch"
**Solution:**
1. Add production URL to Supabase Auth settings
2. Update Google OAuth authorized redirect URIs
3. Format: `https://your-domain.com/auth/callback`

### Issue: "Build fails on Vercel"
**Solution:**
1. Ensure all environment variables are set in Vercel
2. Check Node version matches local (18.x or 20.x)
3. Clear build cache and retry

## üéâ Launch Day!

Remember: Your security is appropriately simplified for a barbershop booking app. Don't let anyone convince you to add complex security that breaks authentication. 

The app is ready to ship with:
- ‚úÖ Supabase authentication
- ‚úÖ Row Level Security
- ‚úÖ Basic input validation
- ‚úÖ HTTPS everywhere
- ‚úÖ Stripe payment security

Good luck with your launch! üöÄ
