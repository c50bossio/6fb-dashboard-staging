## 🚀 Step-by-Step Fix Instructions

### Step 1: Generate New SendGrid API Key

1. **Login to SendGrid Dashboard**:
   - Go to https://app.sendgrid.com/
   - Login with your account credentials

2. **Create New API Key**:
   - Navigate to Settings → API Keys
   - Click "Create API Key"
   - Choose "Full Access" for marketing campaigns
   - Name it "6FB-Marketing-Platform-API"
   - **Copy the new API key immediately** (you won't see it again)

3. **Update Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   # Update .env file with new API key
   SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.your-new-api-key-here
   ```

### Step 2: Domain Authentication Setup

#### Option A: Domain Authentication (Recommended)
1. **Add Domain Authentication**:
   - Go to Settings → Sender Authentication → Domain Authentication
   - Click "Authenticate Your Domain"
   - Enter domain: `6fbmentorship.com`
   - Choose "Yes" for branded links
   - Follow DNS setup instructions

2. **DNS Configuration**:
   Add these DNS records to your domain provider:
   ```
   # CNAME Records (provided by SendGrid)
   em3014._domainkey.6fbmentorship.com -> em3014.dkim.sendgrid.net
   s1._domainkey.6fbmentorship.com -> s1.domainkey.u3014.wl.sendgrid.net
   s2._domainkey.6fbmentorship.com -> s2.domainkey.u3014.wl.sendgrid.net
   ```

#### Option B: Single Sender Verification (Quick Fix)
1. **Add Verified Sender**:
   - Go to Settings → Sender Authentication → Single Sender Verification
   - Click "Create New Sender"
   - Enter details:
     - From Name: `6FB AI Agents`
     - From Email: `support@em3014.6fbmentorship.com`
     - Reply To: `support@em3014.6fbmentorship.com`
     - Company Address: Your business address
   - Click "Create"
   - Check email for verification link

2. **Verify Email**:
   - Check inbox for verification email
   - Click verification link
   - Return to SendGrid dashboard to confirm

### Step 3: Test Email Functionality

Run the diagnostic script to test:
```bash
node test-sendgrid-diagnosis.js
```

Expected output for working setup:
```
✅ API Key Valid
✅ Domain Found: em3014.6fbmentorship.com
✅ Sender Found: support@em3014.6fbmentorship.com
✅ Test Email Sent Successfully
```

### Step 4: Update Production Configuration

1. **Update Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   # Production-ready configuration
   SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.your-verified-api-key
   SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=support@em3014.6fbmentorship.com
   SENDGRID_FROM_NAME=6FB AI Agents
   PLATFORM_DOMAIN=bookedbarber.com
   ```

2. **Test White-label Campaign**:
   ```bash
   node services/sendgrid-service-fixed.js
   ```

## 🔧 Alternative Solutions

### If Domain Access is Limited

1. **Use Different Domain**:
   - Use a domain you control completely
   - Example: `marketing.yourdomain.com`
   - Set up DNS records properly

2. **Use SendGrid Subdomain**:
   - Let SendGrid provide subdomain
   - Format: `em1234.yourdomain.com`
   - Easier DNS setup

### Development Testing Setup

1. **For Development**:
   ```bash
   # Use verified personal email for testing
   SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=your-verified-email@gmail.com
   SENDGRID_FROM_NAME=Test Sender
   ```

2. **Verify Personal Email**:
   - Add your personal email as verified sender
   - Use for development and testing
   - Switch to custom domain for production
