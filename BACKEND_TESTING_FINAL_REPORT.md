## üö® Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. Authentication System Breakdown
**Severity:** üö® **Critical**  
**Impact:** 44% of endpoints failing due to auth issues

**Problem:**
- User registration returns 500 Internal Server Error
- Login authentication failing for existing users  
- Password hashing inconsistencies in database

**Solution:**
```python
# Fix password hashing consistency
def hash_password(password: str, user_email: str) -> str:
    salt = f"{user_email}-6fb-salt"  # User-specific salt
    return hashlib.sha256(f"{password}{salt}".encode()).hexdigest()

# Fix database user lookup
cursor = conn.execute(
    "SELECT id, email, password_hash, shop_name FROM users WHERE email = ? AND is_active = 1",
    (user.email,)
)
```

### 2. POST Endpoint 500 Errors
**Severity:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **High**  
**Impact:** Settings and chat functionality broken

**Problem:**
- Database write operations failing under authenticated load
- Possible SQLite concurrency issues
- Missing error handling in business logic

**Solution:**
- Implement proper database connection pooling
- Add comprehensive error logging
- Review SQLite WAL mode configuration

### 3. Production Environment Configuration
**Severity:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **High**  
**Impact:** System running with development settings

**Missing Production Settings:**
```bash
# Required environment variables
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...          # Currently missing
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...   # Currently missing  
GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=...          # Currently missing
NODE_ENV=production            # Currently development
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...   # Currently SQLite
