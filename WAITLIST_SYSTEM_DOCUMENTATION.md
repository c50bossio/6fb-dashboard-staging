## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### 1. Database Setup

Run the database schema to create all necessary tables:

```bash
# Apply the schema to your database
sqlite3 database/agent_system.db < database/waitlist-cancellation-schema.sql

# Or using the Python initialization
python -c "
from services.waitlist_cancellation_service import WaitlistCancellationService
service = WaitlistCancellationService()
print('✅ Database initialized')
"
```

### 2. Environment Configuration

Add these environment variables for full functionality:

```bash
# Payment Processing (existing)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_...

# Email Notifications
SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.xxxxx
FROM_EMAIL=notifications@yourbarbershop.com

# SMS Notifications  
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=ACxxxxx
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=xxxxx
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+1234567890

# Push Notifications (optional)
PUSH_SERVICE_URL=https://your-push-service.com/send
PUSH_SERVICE_KEY=xxxxx

# AI Services (existing)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxx
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-xxxxx
```

### 3. Service Integration

Import and use the services in your application:

```python
from services.waitlist_cancellation_service import WaitlistCancellationService
from services.waitlist_integration_service import WaitlistIntegrationService

# Initialize services
waitlist_service = WaitlistCancellationService()
integration_service = WaitlistIntegrationService()

# Example: Add customer to waitlist
result = await waitlist_service.join_waitlist(
    customer_id="customer_123",
    barbershop_id="barbershop_456", 
    service_id="haircut_premium",
    priority="high",
    preferred_dates=[datetime.now() + timedelta(days=1)],
    preferred_times=["14:00-17:00"]
)

print(f"Joined waitlist at position {result['position']}")
```

### 4. Frontend Integration

Use the React components in your frontend:

```jsx
import WaitlistJoinModal from './components/waitlist/WaitlistJoinModal';
import WaitlistStatusDashboard from './components/waitlist/WaitlistStatusDashboard';

function BookingPage() {
    const [showWaitlist, setShowWaitlist] = useState(false);
    
    return (
        <div>
            <button onClick={() => setShowWaitlist(true)}>
                Join Waitlist
            </button>
            
            <WaitlistJoinModal 
                isOpen={showWaitlist}
                onClose={() => setShowWaitlist(false)}
                service={selectedService}
                barbershop={barbershop}
                onSuccess={(result) => {
                    console.log('Joined waitlist:', result);
                    setShowWaitlist(false);
                }}
            />
            
            <WaitlistStatusDashboard 
                customerId={currentUser.id}
            />
