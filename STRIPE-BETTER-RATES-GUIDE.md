# How to Get Better Stripe Rates & Be More Competitive

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Answer: Yes, You Can Get Much Better Rates!

### Current Situation
- **Stripe charges you**: 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction
- **To be competitive**: You need rates around 2.2-2.5%
- **Goal**: Get Stripe down to 1.8-2.2% so you can charge merchants 2.0-2.5%

## ðŸ“ž Step 1: Contact Stripe Sales (Immediate)

Once you hit **$80K/month** in processing volume:

1. **Email**: sales@stripe.com
2. **Subject**: "Volume Pricing Request - BookedBarber Platform"
3. **Include**:
   - Current monthly volume
   - Projected growth (3, 6, 12 months)
   - Business model (marketplace for barbershops)
   - Request for volume pricing tiers

### What to Expect:
- **$80K-250K/month**: 2.5% + $0.25 (save 0.4%)
- **$250K-1M/month**: 2.2% + $0.22 (save 0.7%)
- **$1M+/month**: 1.8% + $0.10 (save 1.1%)

## ðŸ’³ Step 2: Implement Cost-Saving Features (This Week)

### A. Enable ACH Payments (65% Lower Cost!)
```javascript
// In your payment processing
if (amount > 500) {
  // Suggest ACH for large payments
  showACHOption = true;
  // ACH costs 0.8% vs 2.9% for cards!
}
```

**Your Competitive Advantage**:
- Cards: You charge 2.5% (competitive with Square's 2.6%)
- ACH: You charge 1.0% (massive savings for merchants!)

### B. Store Cards for Repeat Customers
```javascript
// Reduces interchange by 0.10%
const customer = await stripe.customers.create({
  payment_method: paymentMethodId,
  invoice_settings: {
    default_payment_method: paymentMethodId,
  },
});
```

### C. Add Level II/III Data (B2B Transactions)
```javascript
// Saves 0.20-0.50% on interchange
const paymentIntent = await stripe.paymentIntents.create({
  amount: 10000,
  level3: {
    merchant_reference: 'INV-2024-001',
    customer_reference: 'CUST-123',
    line_items: [{
      product_code: 'HAIRCUT',
      product_description: 'Premium Haircut Service',
      unit_cost: 5000,
      quantity: 2
    }]
  }
});
```

## ðŸš€ Step 3: Apply for Interchange++ Pricing

### When You Qualify (at $250K+/month):

1. **Request Interchange++ pricing** from Stripe
2. **How it works**:
   - Pay actual interchange (1.5-2.1% average)
   - Plus network fees (0.14%)
   - Plus Stripe markup (0.25%)
   - **Total: ~2.2% average** (vs 2.9% standard)

3. **Your merchant pricing**:
   - You pay: 2.2%
   - You charge: 2.4%
   - Still beats Square (2.6%), PayPal (3.49%)!

## ðŸ’° Step 4: Competitive Pricing Structure

### Recommended Merchant Pricing (After You Get Better Rates):

```javascript
const competitivePricing = {
  starter: {
    card: "2.6% + $0.25", // Still beats Square
    ach: "1.0% (capped at $5)", // Huge savings
    monthly: "$29"
  },
  professional: {
    card: "2.4% + $0.20", // Volume discount
    ach: "0.8% (capped at $5)",
    monthly: "$79"
  },
  enterprise: {
    card: "2.2% + $0.15", // Best rates
    ach: "0.6% (capped at $5)",
    monthly: "$199"
  }
};
```

## ðŸ“Š Step 5: Alternative Payment Methods

### Bank Transfers (Via Plaid)
- **Cost to you**: $0.50 per transfer
- **Charge merchants**: $1 flat fee
- **Perfect for**: Invoices over $500

### Implementation:
```javascript
// Add to your payment options
const plaid = require('plaid');
// Offer for high-value transactions
if (amount > 50000) { // $500+
  offerBankTransfer = true; // $1 flat vs $14.50 in card fees!
}
```
