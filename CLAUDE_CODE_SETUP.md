## üéØ How to Use Claude Code Review

### Automatic Reviews
- **New Pull Requests**: Claude will automatically review new PRs
- **PR Updates**: When you push new commits to a PR

### Interactive Reviews  
- **Comment with @claude**: Mention @claude in any:
  - Pull request comment
  - Pull request review comment
  - Issue comment
- **Ask specific questions**: "[@claude] Can you review the security of this authentication code?"
- **Request implementations**: "[@claude] Can you help implement error handling for this API endpoint?"

### Example Usage:
```
@claude Please review this payment processing code for security vulnerabilities and suggest improvements.
```

```
@claude Can you help refactor this component to improve performance?
```

```  
@claude What's the best way to handle errors in this API endpoint?
```

## üîí Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit secrets** to your repository
2. **Use GitHub Secrets** for all API keys and tokens
3. **Review AI suggestions** before implementing them
4. **Limit repository access** to necessary team members
5. **Monitor API usage** to prevent unexpected costs

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**1. "No ANTHROPIC_API_KEY found"**
- Ensure you've added the API key to repository secrets
- Check the secret name matches exactly: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`

**2. "GitHub App authentication failed"**
- Verify the App ID and private key are correct
- Ensure the GitHub App is installed on your repository
- Check that the private key format is correct (entire .pem file contents)

**3. "Claude not responding to @mentions"**
- Check if the workflow is enabled in Actions tab
- Verify the GitHub App has correct permissions
- Ensure you're using @claude (not @Claude or other variations)

**4. "Workflow not triggering"**
- Check repository Actions tab for failed runs
- Verify the workflow file syntax is correct
- Ensure the GitHub App events are configured properly

### Getting Help:

1. **Check GitHub Actions logs** in your repository's Actions tab
2. **Review Claude Code documentation**: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/github-actions
3. **Verify your API key** at https://console.anthropic.com/
4. **Test with simple @claude mentions** in issues first

## üöÄ Advanced Configuration

### Custom Instructions
You can modify the `instructions` field in the workflow file to customize how Claude reviews your code:

```yaml
instructions: |
  Focus on these specific areas:
  - Security vulnerabilities
  - Performance optimizations  
  - Code maintainability
  - Your specific coding standards
```

### Model Selection
Change the Claude model used for reviews:

```yaml
model: "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"  # Latest Sonnet
# or
model: "claude-3-haiku-20240307"     # Faster, more cost-effective
```

### Response Control
Adjust response length and creativity:

```yaml
max-tokens: 4000    # Maximum response length
temperature: 0.1    # Lower = more focused, Higher = more creative
```
