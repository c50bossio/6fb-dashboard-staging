# Risk-Based Notification System Success Criteria & Benchmarks

## Overview
This document defines the success criteria, performance benchmarks, and validation procedures for the risk-based notification system. These benchmarks are based on healthcare and hospitality industry research showing 25-40% no-show reduction with proper communication strategies.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### 1. Risk Assessment Accuracy
**Target: ≥85% correct tier classification**

- **Red Tier Accuracy**: ≥85% of high-risk customers correctly identified
- **Processing Time**: <2 seconds per risk assessment
- **Fallback Rate**: <5% of assessments requiring fallback to default risk

**Validation Method**:
```javascript
// Test with known customer profiles
const knownGreenCustomers = await getCustomersWithHistory('reliable')
const accuracy = await testRiskClassification(knownGreenCustomers, 'green')
expect(accuracy).toBeGreaterThan(0.85)
```

### 2. Notification Delivery Performance

- **Template Rendering**: 100% success rate with proper placeholder replacement
- **Scheduling Accuracy**: ±2 minutes of intended delivery time

**Validation Method**:
```javascript
// Monitor delivery status over 30 days
const deliveryMetrics = await getDeliveryMetrics(barbershopId, '30d')
expect(deliveryMetrics.overall_delivery_rate).toBeGreaterThan(0.95)
```

### 3. System Performance Benchmarks
**Target: Real-time processing without booking delays**

- **End-to-End Booking Processing**: <5 seconds including notification scheduling
- **Risk Assessment**: <2 seconds per customer evaluation
