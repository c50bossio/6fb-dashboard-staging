# 6FB AI Agent System Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
• Create an enterprise-grade barbershop management platform that seamlessly integrates AI-powered business coaching with intelligent booking capabilities
• Establish a unified ecosystem serving both customers (booking appointments) and barbershop professionals (business optimization)
• Deliver real-time, data-driven insights that transform traditional barbershop operations into intelligent, scalable businesses
• Enable multi-location enterprise support with centralized customer databases and cross-location booking capabilities
• Provide comprehensive integration capabilities with existing booking platforms (Square, Calendly, Google Calendar)

### Background Context
The barbershop industry lacks intelligent, integrated management systems that combine customer-facing booking with AI-powered business optimization. Traditional solutions treat booking and business intelligence as separate domains, resulting in fragmented data and missed optimization opportunities. The 6FB AI Agent System addresses this gap by creating a unified platform where booking data becomes the foundation for AI-powered business coaching, enabling barbershops to evolve from service providers to data-driven businesses.
