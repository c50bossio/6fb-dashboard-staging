## ðŸ“Š The Math That Makes It Work

```javascript
// For every payment processed:
Payment Amount: $100.00
Your Rate to Customer: 2.95% + $0.30  // Competitive with Square/Booksy
Actual Stripe Cost: 2.9% + $0.30      // What you pay
Your Markup: 0.05% ($0.05)            // Your margin

// Credit Allocation:
Platform Markup: 0.6% ($0.60)         // Hidden markup for credits
Campaign Fund: 50% of markup ($0.30)  // Goes to credits
SMS Credits Earned: 12                // At $0.025 per SMS
Email Credits: 100                     // Essentially free

// Customer Perception:
They see: 2.95% (competitive rate)
They get: "Free" SMS worth $95/month at $25k volume
Result: High retention + grateful customers
```
