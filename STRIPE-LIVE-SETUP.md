1. **Visual Banner**: A yellow warning banner appears on production site
2. **Payment Failures**: Customers can't complete real transactions
3. **Dashboard Shows Test Data**: Stripe dashboard shows "Test mode"
4. **Keys Start with `sk_test_` or `pk_test_`**: These are TEST keys!

### In Stripe Dashboard:
1. Toggle to "Live mode"
2. Check `Payments` ‚Üí Should show real transactions
3. Check `Connect` ‚Üí Should show connected barber accounts

```bash
# This should show all green checkmarks
npm run stripe:validate:prod
```

## üîÑ Switching from Test to Live

If you've been using test mode and need to switch:

1. **Update ALL environment variables** in Vercel:
   - Change `sk_test_...` ‚Üí `sk_live_...`
   - Change `pk_test_...` ‚Üí `pk_live_...`

2. **Trigger new deployment**:
   ```bash
   git commit --allow-empty -m "Deploy: Switch to Stripe live mode"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Verify the switch**:
   - Check the site for green confirmation banner
   - Make a small test transaction ($1)
