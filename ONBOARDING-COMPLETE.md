### 3. Resume Functionality

- **Minimize** - Minimize to corner, continue working
- **Banner** - Dashboard banner to resume incomplete setup
- **Force Show** - Programmatic control to show onboarding
- **LocalStorage** - Tracks if user skipped to avoid re-showing

### 4. Data Persistence
- **Auto-save** every 30 seconds

- **Step data** persisted between sessions

### 5. Complete Wiring
All components are fully integrated:
- Step-by-step navigation
- Progress indicators
- Validation and error handling
- Data flow to API endpoints
- Database updates on completion

## User Experience Flow

1. **First Visit**: Onboarding overlay appears automatically if not completed
2. **Can Skip**: User can skip for now, onboarding minimizes
3. **Resume Later**: Banner or button to resume when ready
4. **Auto-Save**: Progress saved every 30 seconds
5. **Complete**: Updates profile, creates barbershop, adds services

## Analytics Events Tracked

```javascript
// Funnel events
onboarding_started
onboarding_step_viewed
onboarding_step_completed
onboarding_step_skipped
onboarding_field_interaction
onboarding_validation_error
onboarding_data_saved
onboarding_abandoned
onboarding_minimized
onboarding_restored
onboarding_completed

// With detailed properties:
- step_name
- step_number
- total_steps
- time_spent_seconds
- completion_rate
- error_details
```

## API Endpoints

1. **POST /api/onboarding/save-progress**
   - Saves current step data
   - Updates profile progress
   - Tracks analytics events

2. **POST /api/onboarding/complete**
   - Marks onboarding complete
   - Creates/updates barbershop
   - Adds services
   - Final analytics tracking

## Testing Results

```

## How to Use

### For Users:
1. Dashboard automatically shows onboarding if not complete
2. Can skip and resume anytime via dashboard banner
3. Progress saves automatically every 30 seconds
4. All data persists between sessions

### For Developers:
```javascript
// Force show onboarding
<DashboardOnboarding forceShow={true} />

// Check if user skipped
const wasSkipped = localStorage.getItem('onboarding_skipped') === 'true'

// Track custom events
internalAnalytics.onboarding.stepCompleted('custom_step', data)
```

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files:

- `/lib/analytics-queries.js` - Analytics query helpers
- `/components/onboarding/BusinessInfoSetup.js`
- `/components/onboarding/StaffSetup.js`
- `/components/onboarding/ScheduleSetup.js`
- `/components/onboarding/BookingRulesSetup.js`

### Updated Files:

## Performance Considerations

- Components lazy-load as needed
- Auto-save throttled to 30 seconds
- Analytics batched where possible
- LocalStorage used for client-side state
- Minimal re-renders with proper React patterns

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

While the onboarding is 100% complete, these could be future enhancements:
1. A/B testing different onboarding flows
2. Video tutorials for complex steps
3. Import data from other platforms
4. Multi-language support
5. Advanced analytics dashboards
