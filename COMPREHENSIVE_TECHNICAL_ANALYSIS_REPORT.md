## 🔒 SECURITY & COMPLIANCE REPORT

### Critical Vulnerabilities Requiring Immediate Action

**Authentication & Authorization (CRITICAL)**
```python
# VULNERABLE: Hardcoded secrets throughout codebase
SECRET_KEY = "6fb-ai-agent-system-secret-key-change-in-production"

# VULNERABLE: Weak password hashing
def hash_password(password: str) -> str:
    salt = "6fb-salt"  # Static salt - CRITICAL VULNERABILITY
    return hashlib.sha256(f"{password}{salt}".encode()).hexdigest()

# VULNERABLE: Default admin credentials
admin_user = "admin@6fb-ai.com / admin123"
```

**API Security (HIGH RISK)**
```python
# VULNERABLE: Overly permissive CORS
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],  # Too broad
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],  # Overly permissive
    allow_headers=["*"],  # Overly permissive
)

# VULNERABLE: No input sanitization
const { message, sessionId, businessContext } = await request.json()
// Direct use without validation - XSS/Injection risk
```

**Data Protection (CRITICAL)**
```env
# EXPOSED: Real API keys in version control
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=364e7fa69a829323dd01a0c222309439
SENDGRID_API_KEY=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
