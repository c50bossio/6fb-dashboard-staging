### 🎯 Root Cause Analysis

The registration system is **technically functioning correctly**. The issue is likely one of the following email delivery problems:

#### **Primary Suspects:**

1. **🔧 Default Supabase SMTP Limitations**
   - Supabase uses a default SMTP service that has limited deliverability
   - Emails from `noreply@mail.supabase.io` may be filtered by email providers
   - Many email services (Gmail, Outlook) treat default SMTP as suspicious

2. **📧 Email Provider Filtering**
   - Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo have aggressive spam filtering for automated emails
   - Emails likely going to spam/junk folders
   - Some providers block automated emails from unknown senders

3. **⏰ Email Delivery Delays**
   - Default SMTP can have delays of 1-15 minutes
   - Users expect instant delivery but emails may arrive later
   - No immediate feedback about delivery status

### 🚨 Immediate Action Items

#### **For Testing:**
1. **Check Spam Folders**
   - Look for emails from `noreply@mail.supabase.io`
   - Check all spam/junk/promotion folders
   - Test with multiple email providers (Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo)

2. **Verify Supabase Dashboard Settings**
   - Visit: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/dfhqjdoydihajmjxniee/auth/settings
   - Ensure "Enable email confirmations" is ON
   - Check Site URL matches: `http://localhost:9999`
   - Add redirect URL: `http://localhost:9999/dashboard`

3. **Manual Browser Testing**
   - Open DevTools → Network tab
   - Register with real email address
   - Monitor POST requests to `dfhqjdoydihajmjxniee.supabase.co/auth/v1/signup`
   - Verify 200 OK responses and proper data structure

#### **For Production Fix:**

1. **Configure Custom SMTP (Recommended)**
   - Set up SendGrid, Mailgun, or similar service
   - Add SMTP credentials in Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → SMTP Settings
   - This will dramatically improve email deliverability

2. **Customize Email Templates**
   - Update email templates in Supabase Dashboard
   - Add proper sender name and branding
   - Include clear call-to-action buttons

3. **Add Email Status Monitoring**
   - Implement webhook endpoints to track email delivery
   - Add user-facing status indicators
   - Provide alternative verification methods
