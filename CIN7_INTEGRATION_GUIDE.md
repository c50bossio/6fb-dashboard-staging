# CIN7 Integration Guide: Transitioning from Mock Data to Real Inventory

## Overview
This guide will help you transition your product inventory page from using mock data to displaying actual data from your CIN7 integration.

## Prerequisites
1. CIN7 Account with API access
2. CIN7 API Key and Account ID

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Get Your CIN7 API Credentials

1. Log into your CIN7 account at [inventory.dearsystems.com](https://inventory.dearsystems.com)
2. Navigate to **Settings** (gear icon)
3. Go to **Integrations & API** â†’ **API v2**
4. Note your **Account ID**
5. Click **Add API Application** to create a new API key
6. Copy the generated **API Application Key**

### 2. Connect CIN7 to Your Application

#### Option A: Via Product Inventory Page
1. Navigate to `/shop/products` in your application
2. Look for the CIN7 connection button (usually at the bottom or in settings)
3. Enter your Account ID and API Key
4. Click "Connect"

#### Option B: Via Dashboard Inventory Page
1. Navigate to `/dashboard/inventory`
2. Look for "Advanced: Connect warehouse system" link at the bottom
3. Enter your credentials in the modal

### 3. Initial Sync

After connecting, the system will:
1. Automatically sync your products from CIN7
2. Map them to the correct categories (hair_care, beard_care, tools, accessories, etc.)
3. Import stock levels, pricing, and product details
4. Set up webhooks for real-time updates (if supported)

### 4. Understanding the Sync Process

The sync process includes:
- **Pagination**: Handles large product catalogs by fetching in batches
- **Rate Limiting**: Respects CIN7's API limits (3 calls/second, 60/minute, 5000/day)
- **Stock Mapping**: Uses CIN7's "Available" field as primary stock indicator
- **Category Mapping**: Automatically categorizes products based on names/descriptions

### 5. Monitoring and Maintenance

#### Check Sync Status
```javascript
// The UI will show:
- Last sync time
- Number of products synced
- Low stock alerts
- Out of stock counts
```

#### Manual Sync
- Click "Refresh Inventory" button to manually sync
- Recommended: Set up automatic sync every 15-30 minutes

#### Troubleshooting Common Issues

**"Everything shows out of stock"**
- Ensure your CIN7 products have stock levels set
- Check that location/warehouse is configured correctly
- Verify API permissions include stock data access

**"No products appearing"**
- Confirm API credentials are correct
- Check that products exist in CIN7
- Ensure products are marked as "Active" in CIN7

**"Sync fails with error"**
- Check API rate limits haven't been exceeded
- Verify network connectivity
- Ensure credentials haven't expired

### 6. API Best Practices (Implemented)

Our integration follows CIN7 API v2 best practices:

1. **Efficient Data Fetching**
   - Uses pagination (100 items per page)
   - Only syncs changed items when possible
   - Implements proper error handling

2. **Rate Limit Management**
   - Automatic delays between requests
   - Handles 429 errors gracefully
   - Queues requests to stay within limits

3. **Data Integrity**
   - Maps all relevant fields (SKU, barcode, pricing, stock)
   - Handles missing data gracefully
   - Preserves local customizations

### 7. Using the Data

Once synced, your products will:
- Appear in the products table automatically
- Update stock levels in real-time (with webhooks)
- Show accurate pricing from CIN7
- Display low stock warnings

### 8. Advanced Features

#### Webhooks (Automatic Updates)
The system automatically registers webhooks for:
- Stock level changes
- Product modifications
- Sale completions

#### Professional Product Detection
Products are automatically marked as "professional use" based on:
- Brand names (Wahl, Andis, etc.)
- Product descriptions
- Category classifications

### 9. Security

Your CIN7 credentials are:
- Encrypted using AES-256-GCM encryption
- Stored securely in the database
- Never exposed in client-side code
- Associated with your specific barbershop
