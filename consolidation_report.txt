CONSOLIDATION STRATEGY:
1. Create unified master database with all required tables
2. Migrate data from all instances to master database
3. Update all application code to use unified database
4. Archive/delete redundant database files

CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED:
- Data scattered across 25 separate files
- Potential schema inconsistencies
- No centralized data integrity
- Performance impact from multiple connections
