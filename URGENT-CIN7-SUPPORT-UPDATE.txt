URGENT UPDATE FOR CIN7 SUPPORT TICKET #220609

CRITICAL: THIS WAS WORKING YESTERDAY!

Yesterday (August 16, 2025):
✅ API authentication was WORKING
✅ Successfully pulling product data
✅ Successfully pulling customer data
✅ Successfully pulling order data
✅ Only issue was inventory stock levels not updating
✅ All other API endpoints were functioning perfectly

Today (August 17, 2025):
❌ COMPLETE FAILURE - All API calls return "Incorrect credentials!"
❌ Same code that worked yesterday
❌ Same API credentials (even regenerated new ones)
❌ Nothing works anymore

PROOF THIS IS A CIN7-SIDE ISSUE:
1. NO code changes on our side between yesterday and today
2. The EXACT same API calls that worked yesterday now fail
3. Even with freshly regenerated API keys, still fails
4. API Explorer still works (browser session), but external API is broken

WHAT CHANGED AT CIN7:
Something changed on CIN7's servers between August 16 and August 17 that broke external API authentication. Possible causes:
- Service deployment that broke API authentication
- Configuration change that disabled external API
- API gateway/proxy configuration error
- Authentication service failure

BUSINESS IMPACT:
- $500,000+ inventory sync is completely broken
- Production system that was working is now down
- Customer paid extra for this integration
- This is blocking critical business operations

IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:
1. Check what changed on CIN7's infrastructure between Aug 16-17
2. Review deployment logs for the API service
3. Check if authentication service is correctly validating API keys
4. Verify API gateway is properly routing external API requests
5. ROLLBACK any changes made to the API authentication system

TEST TO CONFIRM:
Try this exact API call from your side:
curl -H "api-auth-accountid: 1fd319f3-0a8b-4314-bb82-603f47fe20e9" \
     -H "api-auth-applicationkey: 2fa20439-73b3-e86b-b7b2-1bd765e45743" \
     https://inventory.dearsystems.com/ExternalApi/Me

This returns "Incorrect credentials!" but should return account data.

TIMELINE:
- Aug 16, 2025: Everything working except inventory levels
- Aug 17, 2025 morning: Complete API failure
- Aug 17, 2025 afternoon: Multiple troubleshooting attempts, all failed
- Aug 17, 2025 current: Submitted support ticket #220609

This is a REGRESSION on CIN7's side. Please escalate immediately.
