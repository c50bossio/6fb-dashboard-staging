## 📋 Test Categories

### **Phase 1: Component Integration Testing**

#### Progressive Disclosure System
```javascript
// Tests 3-step business info flow
// Validates form progression and field validation
// Ensures live preview updates in real-time
```
- ✅ Modal renders with segmentation options
- ✅ 3-step progressive disclosure navigation
- ✅ Form validation prevents progression until required fields complete
- ✅ Live preview updates with form data

#### Contextual Tooltip System
```javascript
// Tests 5 semantic tooltip types
// Validates auto-positioning and micro-interactions
// Ensures hover/focus/click triggers work correctly
```
- ✅ Tooltips display on hover with proper positioning
- ✅ Focus micro-interactions show visual feedback
- ✅ Semantic types (info, tip, warning, success, magic) function correctly

### **Phase 2: AI Integration & Smart Suggestions**

#### SmartSuggestionsAPI Integration
```javascript
// Tests all 4 API endpoints
// Validates AI-powered recommendations
// Ensures graceful fallback when APIs unavailable
```
- ✅ API calls triggered by form interactions
- ✅ AI suggestions panel displays with recommendations
- ✅ Graceful API failure handling and fallback behavior

#### Adaptive Flow Engine
```javascript
// Tests intelligent flow modification
// Validates segmentation-based step changes
// Ensures contextual help adapts to user type
```
- ✅ Flow adapts for first barbershop owner path
- ✅ Multi-location expansion gets streamlined flow
- ✅ System migration shows data import steps first

### **Phase 3: Performance & Accessibility**

#### Performance Benchmarks
```javascript
// Measures Core Web Vitals
// Validates load times and responsiveness
// Tests API response times and bundle impact
```
- ✅ Page loads within 3 seconds
- ✅ Modal renders within 2 seconds  
- ✅ Step transitions under 1 second
- ✅ Core Web Vitals meet standards (FCP < 1.8s, LCP < 2.5s, CLS < 0.1)

#### Accessibility Compliance
```javascript
// Tests WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
// Validates keyboard navigation and screen reader support
// Ensures color contrast and focus management
```
- ✅ Keyboard navigation works throughout flow
- ✅ Screen reader compatibility with proper ARIA labels
- ✅ Color contrast meets WCAG standards
- ✅ Focus management traps focus within modal

### **Phase 4: Complete User Journey Validation**

#### End-to-End Journeys
```javascript  
// Tests complete onboarding flows
// Validates data persistence and state management
// Ensures all segmentation paths work end-to-end
```
- ✅ First barbershop owner completes full journey
- ✅ Multi-location user gets adapted experience
- ✅ Migration user sees data import workflow

## 🛠 Test Configuration

    businessHours: { ... },
    services: [ ... ]
  },
  confidence: 0.85,
  insights: ["Based on local market analysis"]
}

// Pricing suggestions mock  
{
  success: true,
  suggestions: {
    baseServices: [ ... ],
    premiumServices: [ ... ]
  },
  marketAnalysis: { ... },
  revenueProjections: { ... }
}
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

#### Tests Fail with "Modal not visible"
```bash
# Check if development server is running
npm run dev

# Verify auth configuration
# Ensure test user credentials are correct
```

#### API Mocks Not Working
```javascript
// Ensure setupSmartSuggestionsRoutes is called in beforeEach
setupSmartSuggestionsRoutes(page, 'success')

// Check network tab in browser for API calls
// Verify mock responses match expected format
```

#### Performance Tests Fail
```javascript
// Check system resources during test
// Ensure no other applications consuming CPU/memory
// Run tests on dedicated testing machine if possible
```

### **Debug Mode**
```bash
# Run tests in headed mode to see browser
npx playwright test --headed

# Run specific test with debug
npx playwright test tests/onboarding-enhancement-system.spec.js --debug

# Generate trace for failed test
npx playwright show-trace test-results/trace.zip
```
