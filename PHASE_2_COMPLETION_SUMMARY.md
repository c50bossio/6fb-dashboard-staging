## ðŸ§  AI Intelligence Features

### Message Classification Engine
The system intelligently routes messages based on content analysis:

```python
def classify_message_type(message: str) -> MessageType:
    # Advanced regex-based classification
    # Routes to optimal AI provider based on strengths
```

### Business Context Integration
Every AI response includes relevant business context:
- Shop information and location
- Current metrics and performance data
- Historical patterns and trends
- Industry-specific recommendations

### Intelligent Response Generation
Sophisticated response system with:
- **Business Analysis**: Revenue optimization, KPI tracking, performance insights
- **Customer Service**: Retention strategies, satisfaction improvement, feedback systems
- **Scheduling**: Optimization techniques, booking efficiency, time management
- **Financial**: Pricing strategies, cost management, profit optimization
- **Marketing**: Social media guidance, local promotion, brand building

## ðŸ“Š Enhanced Response Examples

### Business Analysis Response:
```
"Based on your current metrics, I notice opportunities for revenue optimization.

**Revenue Optimization:**
- Your average ticket is $35, but top 20% of customers spend $55+
- Services like beard treatments have 40% higher margins
- Peak hours (10am-2pm) are underutilized with only 70% booking capacity

**Actionable Next Steps:**
1. Track customer lifetime value to identify your most valuable clients
2. Implement dynamic pricing during peak hours
3. Create service packages to encourage longer visits

Would you like me to dive deeper into any of these areas?"
```

### Customer Service Response:
```
"Customer satisfaction is the foundation of a successful barbershop.

**Customer Experience Enhancement:**
- Personalization: Remember customer preferences and personal details
- Communication: Send appointment reminders 24h and 1h before
- Feedback Loop: Quick 2-question survey after each visit

**Retention Strategies:**
- Loyalty program: 10th cut free or 15% off after 5 visits
- Birthday month discount: 20% off during customer's birth month
- Referral rewards: $10 credit for both referrer and new customer

**Quick Implementation:**
Start with appointment reminders and simple satisfaction surveys.
This alone can increase retention by 12-15%.

What aspect of customer service would you like to focus on first?"
```

## ðŸ”§ Technical Architecture

### AI Provider Selection Logic
```python
selection_preferences = {
    MessageType.BUSINESS_ANALYSIS: [AIProvider.ANTHROPIC, AIProvider.OPENAI, AIProvider.GEMINI],
    MessageType.CUSTOMER_SERVICE: [AIProvider.OPENAI, AIProvider.ANTHROPIC, AIProvider.GEMINI],
    MessageType.SCHEDULING: [AIProvider.GEMINI, AIProvider.OPENAI, AIProvider.ANTHROPIC],
    MessageType.FINANCIAL: [AIProvider.ANTHROPIC, AIProvider.OPENAI, AIProvider.GEMINI],
    MessageType.MARKETING: [AIProvider.OPENAI, AIProvider.GEMINI, AIProvider.ANTHROPIC]
}
```

### Conversation Flow
1. **Message Reception**: User sends message via dashboard
2. **Classification**: AI Orchestrator classifies message type
3. **Provider Selection**: Optimal AI provider chosen based on capabilities
4. **Context Building**: Business context and conversation history added
5. **AI Processing**: Selected provider generates response
6. **Enhancement**: Response enriched with recommendations and metadata
7. **Persistence**: Conversation stored in Supabase
8. **Delivery**: Enhanced response sent back to user
