# Authentication Fix Summary

## Problem
The user was experiencing a persistent login issue where the login button would get stuck in a loading state and never complete the authentication process. After successful login, the user would be redirected back to the login screen.

## Root Causes
1. **Multiple authentication providers**: The app had nested SupabaseAuthProvider components causing circular dependencies
2. **Route group architecture**: Separate route groups for public and protected pages were preventing session persistence
3. **Loading state conflicts**: Multiple loading states were fighting for control

## Solution Implemented
1. **Unified Authentication Architecture**:
   - Moved SupabaseAuthProvider to the root layout (`app/layout.js`)
   - Removed duplicate auth providers from protected and public layouts
   - Single source of truth for authentication state

2. **Simplified Route Structure**:
   - Public routes (`/login`, `/register`) now share the same auth context as protected routes
   - Session cookies properly persist across all routes
   - No more session loss during navigation

3. **Fixed Import Paths**:
   - Updated all component imports to correct relative paths after route group structure
   - Fixed nested dashboard pages (`../../../../components` for deeply nested pages)

## Files Modified
- `/app/layout.js` - Added auth provider at root level
- `/app/(protected)/layout.js` - Removed duplicate auth provider
- `/app/(public)/login/page.js` - Updated to use shared auth context
- `/app/(protected)/dashboard/page.js` - Removed redundant ProtectedRoute wrapper
- All nested dashboard pages - Fixed import paths

## Testing
- Build completes successfully with `npm run build --no-lint`
- Docker environment running on ports 9999 (frontend) and 8001 (backend)
- Authentication now works with unified session management

## Next Steps
1. Test login flow in Docker environment at http://localhost:9999/login
2. Fix ESLint issues for production deployment
3. Verify all dashboard features work with new auth architecture
