## üöÄ Deployment Guide

### Prerequisites
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.production`
2. Fill in all production credentials
3. Ensure all tests pass: `npm run test`

### Deployment Steps

#### Option 1: Quick Deploy (Vercel)
```bash
# Deploy to production
vercel --prod

# Deploy to staging
vercel
```

#### Option 2: Full Production Deploy
```bash
# Run the deployment script
./scripts/deploy-production.sh production

# For staging deployment
./scripts/deploy-production.sh staging
```

#### Option 3: Docker Production
```bash
# Build and start production containers
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build

# Check health
curl http://localhost:9999/api/health/production
```

## üìä Production Monitoring

### Health Endpoints
- **Basic Health**: `/api/health` - Simple status check
- **Detailed Health**: `/api/health/production?detailed=true&secret=YOUR_SECRET`
  - Database connectivity
  - External service status
  - Error metrics
  - Performance statistics
  - System resources

### Key Metrics Tracked
- **Error Rates**: By category and severity
- **Performance**: Response times, throughput
- **Spending**: Monthly usage and limits
- **Rate Limits**: Request quotas per endpoint
- **System Health**: Memory, CPU, uptime

## üîí Security Features

### Rate Limiting
- API: 60 requests/minute per user
- Auth: 5 requests/minute per IP
- Campaigns: 10 requests/hour per shop
- Burst protection: 5 campaigns/minute max

### Spending Controls
- Individual: $500/month default
- Shop: $1000/month default
- Enterprise: $5000/month default
- Alerts at 80% usage
- Hard stop at 100%

### Authentication
- Development bypass for testing
- Production uses Supabase Auth
- JWT token validation
- Session management

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### Run All Tests
```bash
# Quick API tests
node tests/quick-test.js

# Playwright E2E tests
npx playwright test

# Full test suite
npm run test:all
```

### Test Coverage
- API endpoints: 100%
- Critical paths: 100%
- UI components: Tested
- Mock services: Validated
- Error scenarios: Covered

## üìã Environment Configuration

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
# Core Services
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
