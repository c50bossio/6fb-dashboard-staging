# Payment Setup Fix Summary

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Database Schema Issues**
- **Problem**: Missing `customer_pays_processing_fee` column in barbershops table
- **Solution**: Created SQL migration file to add the column
- **Status**: Stripe table exists, fee column needs manual SQL execution

### 2. **Avatar URL Update Error**
- **Problem**: Code tried to update non-existent `avatar_url` column in profiles
- **Solution**: Modified SupabaseAuthProvider to store avatar in memory only
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed - no more 400 errors

### 3. **Authentication & Profile Creation**
- **Problem**: Profile creation had null email issues
- **Solution**: Fixed to properly fetch authenticated user data
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed - profiles create with correct email

### 4. **Subscription Tier Access**
- **Problem**: Users needed `shop_owner` tier to access /shop routes
- **Solution**: Updated profile creation to use correct tier
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed - first users get shop_owner tier
