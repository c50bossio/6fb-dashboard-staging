# Archived Modal-Based Onboarding System

## Files Archived:
- `OnboardingOrchestrator.js` - Main modal orchestrator component
- `DashboardOnboarding.js` - Modal-based onboarding implementation

## Reason for Archiving:
These components implemented a modal-based onboarding system that had critical issues:

1. **State Loss on External Redirects**: When users completed Stripe payment setup and returned to the app, the modal lost its state and appeared to reset progress.

2. **Poor User Experience**: Users had to re-import data and repeat steps after external redirects, causing confusion and frustration.

3. **Blank Screen Issues**: Users experienced blank screens after completing payment setup.

## Replacement System:
Replaced with **OnboardingProgress.js** - a dashboard-embedded checklist widget that:

- ✅ Persists across all navigation and external redirects
- ✅ Shows real-time completion status  
- ✅ Eliminates state loss issues
- ✅ Follows modern SaaS best practices (Linear, Notion, Calendly pattern)

## Architecture Change:
- **Before**: Modal overlay with complex state management
- **After**: Dashboard-embedded widget with database-backed progress tracking

## User Feedback That Led to This Change:
> "after I import my customers and I go to set up my payment, I go to Stripe, I go through the entire process, and once I complete the process, it just goes to a blank screen"

> "Maybe instead of an onboarding dashboard modal, it should be within the web app dashboard. This should just be something we can follow that tracks what we've completed and what we haven't."

The new system directly addresses these concerns and provides a much better user experience.
