## 🔧 System Architecture

### Permission Hierarchy
```
SHOP/ENTERPRISE OWNER (Full Control)
├── Grant permissions to barbers
├── Set pricing variance limits (0-50%)
├── Control service creation rights
└── Manage staff access levels

BARBER (Permission-Based Access)
├── View/modify services (if permitted)
├── Set pricing within variance (if permitted) 
├── Manage schedule and availability
└── Access analytics (based on permission level)
```

### Service Priority System
```
1. BARBER CUSTOMIZATIONS (when permitted)
   ├── Custom pricing (within variance limits)
   ├── Modified descriptions and duration
   └── Personal service offerings

2. SHOP DEFAULTS (fallback)
   ├── Base service catalog
   ├── Standard pricing guidelines
   └── Shop-wide availability rules
```

## 📊 Features Implemented

### For Shop Owners
- ✅ Delegate specific authorities to barbers
- ✅ Set pricing variance limits (±10%, ±20%, etc.)
- ✅ Apply permission templates with one click
- ✅ Monitor staff permission usage
- ✅ Maintain final authority over all services

### For Barbers  
- ✅ Customize services within granted permissions
- ✅ Set personal pricing within allowed variance
- ✅ Manage personal availability and booking rules
- ✅ Clear visual indicators of permission levels
- ✅ Access to personal analytics and commission details

### Permission Templates
- **Basic**: Schedule management, view analytics
- **Intermediate**: Service modification, limited pricing (±10%)
- **Advanced**: Full service control, flexible pricing (±20%)  
- **Full**: Complete autonomy for managers/booth renters

## 🔐 Security & Validation

### Database Security
- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables
- Permission-based policies for data access
- Audit logging for all permission changes
- Foreign key constraints and data integrity

### Application Security
- Permission validation on all service operations
- Real-time constraint checking (pricing, duration)
- Cache invalidation on permission changes
- Graceful fallbacks for unauthorized access

### Data Validation
- Pricing variance constraints (shop-defined limits)
- Duration modification limits  
- Service creation permissions
- Template application validation

## 🚀 Performance Optimizations

### Caching Strategy

- Graceful degradation when database unavailable
- Progressive enhancement of features
- Responsive UI with immediate feedback

## 🧩 Integration Points

### Database Integration
- ✅ Supabase PostgreSQL with comprehensive schema
- ✅ Real-time data synchronization
- ✅ Row Level Security for multi-tenant support
- ✅ Migration scripts for easy deployment

### Authentication Integration  
- ✅ Supabase Auth with role-based access
- ✅ Development bypass for testing
- ✅ Protected routes and middleware
- ✅ Session management and security

### UI Integration

- ✅ Permission indicators and constraint displays
- ✅ Mobile-responsive layouts

## 📋 Database Schema Overview

### Core Tables Created
1. **barber_permissions** - Granular permission control
2. **permission_templates** - Pre-defined permission sets  
3. **permission_audit_log** - Complete audit trail
4. **barbershop_staff** - Staff role management
5. **services** - Base shop service catalog
6. **barber_services** - Individual barber customizations

### Key Relationships
- Users → Barbershops (ownership)
- Barbershops → Staff (employment)
- Staff → Permissions (access control)
- Services → Barber Services (customization)
