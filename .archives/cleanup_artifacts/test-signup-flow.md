# Test OAuth Signup Flow

## ‚úÖ Current Status: Everything is Working Correctly!

Your screenshot shows "Completing Sign In" because you're testing from `/register` without plan data. This is the **correct behavior**.

## üß™ How to Test the Signup Flow

### Test 1: Registration WITHOUT Plan Data (Shows "Sign In")
```
URL: http://localhost:9999/register
Expected: 
- No plan badge shown
- OAuth callback shows "Completing Sign In"
- Result: ‚úÖ WORKING (your screenshot shows this correctly)
```

### Test 2: Registration WITH Plan Data (Shows "Sign Up")  
```
URL: http://localhost:9999/register?plan=shop&billing=monthly
Expected:
- "üìã Plan selected: Shop" badge shown
- OAuth callback shows "Completing Sign Up"  
- Redirects to Stripe checkout
```

### Test 3: Subscribe Page Flow (Shows "Sign Up")
```
URL: http://localhost:9999/subscribe
Steps: Select "Barbershop" plan ‚Üí Click "Start as Shop Owner"
Expected:
- OAuth callback shows "Completing Sign Up"
- Redirects to Stripe checkout
```

## üîß Quick Fix: Test the Right URLs

**Right now, you should test:**
1. Go to: `http://localhost:9999/register?plan=shop&billing=monthly`
2. Look for the green "üìã Plan selected: Shop" badge
3. Click "Sign up with Google"
4. Should show "Completing Sign Up" (not "Sign In")

## üéØ Callback URL Configuration

Your Supabase callback URL should be set to:
```
http://localhost:9999/auth/callback
```

If you're still having issues, check your Supabase Auth settings:
1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/dfhqjdoydihajmjxniee/auth/url-configuration
2. Ensure "Site URL" is set to: `http://localhost:9999`
3. Ensure "Redirect URLs" includes: `http://localhost:9999/auth/callback`

## üêõ Debug Commands

If still not working, run this in browser console during OAuth callback:
```javascript
// Check if plan data was stored
console.log('Plan data:', window.sessionStorage.getItem('oauth_plan_data'))

// Check what URL you came from  
console.log('Referrer:', document.referrer)
```
