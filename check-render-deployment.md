# Render Deployment Status Check

Since we're getting 404 errors, please check these specific items in your Render dashboard:

## 1. Service Overview
- Go to https://dashboard.render.com
- Look for your service (should be named something like "6fb-ai-backend-staging")
- What is the **exact service URL** shown?
- What is the current **status** (Building, Running, Failed, etc.)?

## 2. Build Logs
In the **"Events"** or **"Logs"** tab, look for:

### ✅ Success indicators:
- "Build succeeded"
- "Deploy succeeded" 
- "Service is running"
- No Rust/pydantic errors

### ❌ Failure indicators:
- "Build failed"
- Any error messages in logs
- "Service failed to start"

## 3. Settings Check
In the **"Settings"** tab, verify:
- **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Start Command**: `python start-render.py`
- **Environment**: Python
- **Branch**: staging

## 4. Environment Variables
In the **"Environment"** tab:
- Are any API keys added yet?
- Any error messages about missing variables?

## 5. Common Issues to Look For

### If Build Failed:
- Check for dependency errors in logs
- Look for missing files or import errors

### If Build Succeeded but 404:
- Check if service is actually running
- Verify the correct service URL
- Look for startup errors in runtime logs

### If Service Won't Start:
- Check for errors in `start-render.py`
- Verify `main.py` is accessible
- Look for port binding issues

## 6. Quick Debug Steps

If you can access the service dashboard:
1. Copy the **exact service URL** from the dashboard
2. Check **runtime logs** for any startup errors
3. Verify the **build logs** completed without errors

## 7. Expected Working URLs

Once working, these should return JSON:
- `https://[service-url]/health` → `{"status": "healthy", "service": "6fb-ai-backend"}`
- `https://[service-url]/` → `{"message": "6FB AI Agent System Backend", "status": "running", "version": "1.0.1"}`
- `https://[service-url]/docs` → FastAPI documentation page

Please share what you find in the dashboard!
