### High Priority Issues
- **Analytics page load time is slow (3948ms)**
  Implement code splitting, lazy loading, and optimize images

### Medium Priority Improvements
- **Dashboard has large resource size (2249KB)**
  Optimize bundle splitting and implement tree shaking

- **Analytics has large resource size (2947KB)**
  Optimize bundle splitting and implement tree shaking

- **Dashboard Load and Navigation workflow is slow (6899ms)**
  Optimize workflow performance and add loading states

- **AI Chat Interface Load workflow is slow (10785ms)**
  Optimize workflow performance and add loading states

- **Performance monitoring not comprehensive**
  Implement Real User Monitoring (RUM) and synthetic monitoring

- **No advanced caching strategy detected**
  Implement Redis caching for API responses and database queries

## Performance Optimization Roadmap

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Week 1)
- Fix any failing workflows or API endpoints
- Resolve critical performance bottlenecks
- Implement basic monitoring

### Phase 2: Performance Optimization (Weeks 2-3)
- Optimize slow-loading pages and API endpoints
- Implement caching strategies
- Optimize JavaScript bundles

### Phase 3: Advanced Optimization (Weeks 4-6)
- Implement comprehensive monitoring
- Set up performance budgets
- Advanced caching and CDN implementation

### Phase 4: Scalability Preparation (Weeks 7-8)
- Load testing and capacity planning
- Database optimization
- Infrastructure scaling preparation

## Monitoring Recommendations

1. **Real User Monitoring (RUM):** Implement PostHog or similar for real user performance tracking
2. **Synthetic Monitoring:** Set up automated performance testing
3. **API Monitoring:** Monitor backend API performance and error rates
4. **Infrastructure Monitoring:** Track server resources and database performance
