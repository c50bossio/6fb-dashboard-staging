# OAuth Configuration Fix for 6FB AI Agent System

## Root Cause Analysis
The OAuth authentication is failing because Google Cloud Console redirect URLs don't match the actual OAuth flow.

## Current Issue
- OAuth callbacks are failing and redirecting to `/auth/auth-code-error`
- Google OAuth flow reaches consent screen but fails during code exchange
- Users cannot complete authentication

## Required Google Cloud Console Configuration

### 1. OAuth Consent Screen
- **Authorized domains**: `dfhqjdoydihajmjxniee.supabase.co`
- **Scopes**: 
  - `.../auth/userinfo.email`
  - `.../auth/userinfo.profile` 
  - `openid`

### 2. OAuth Client ID (Web Application)
- **Authorized JavaScript origins**:
  - `https://bookedbarber.com`
  - `https://6fb-ai-dashboard-3y8ryqviu-6fb.vercel.app` (current deployment)
  - `http://localhost:9999` (for local development)

- **Authorized redirect URLs**:
  - `https://dfhqjdoydihajmjxniee.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`

### 3. Supabase Dashboard Configuration
- **Client ID**: [From Google Cloud Console]
- **Client Secret**: [From Google Cloud Console]

## OAuth Flow Explanation
1. User clicks "Sign in with Google" on your app
2. App redirects to Google OAuth consent screen
3. User consents and Google redirects to: `https://dfhqjdoydihajmjxniee.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`
4. Supabase processes the OAuth code and redirects to your app's callback: `/auth/callback`
5. Your app's callback route handles the session and redirects to dashboard

## Critical Points
- **Never** put your app's domain in Google's redirect URLs
- **Always** use the Supabase project callback URL: `https://dfhqjdoydihajmjxniee.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`
- Your app's JavaScript origins should include all domains where the OAuth button appears
- Your app's callback route (`/auth/callback`) handles the final redirect from Supabase

## CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED: Site URL Configuration

### Problem
The `exchangeCodeForSession` is failing because Supabase's **Site URL** configuration doesn't match the production domain where users are initiating OAuth.

### Solution: Fix Supabase Site URL Configuration

#### 1. Update Site URL in Supabase Dashboard
Go to: **Supabase Dashboard â†’ Project Settings â†’ API â†’ Site URL**
- **Current**: Likely set to Vercel URL or localhost
- **Required**: `https://bookedbarber.com`

#### 2. Update Redirect Allow List
Go to: **Supabase Dashboard â†’ Authentication â†’ URL Configuration**
Add these redirect URLs:
- `https://bookedbarber.com/**`
- `https://www.bookedbarber.com/**`
- `https://*-6fb.vercel.app/**` (for staging)
- `http://localhost:9999/**` (for development)

#### 3. Verify Environment Variables
Ensure production environment has:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://bookedbarber.com
```

#### 4. Test OAuth Flow Again
After making these changes:
1. Clear browser cache/cookies
2. Test OAuth from `bookedbarber.com`
3. Verify successful redirect to dashboard

### Why This Fixes the Issue
- Supabase validates the Site URL during `exchangeCodeForSession`
- If the requesting domain doesn't match the configured Site URL, the code exchange fails
- This causes the redirect to auth-code-error page

## Next Steps
1. âœ… Update Google Cloud Console with correct redirect URL (COMPLETED)
2. ðŸ”§ Fix Supabase Site URL configuration (IN PROGRESS)
3. ðŸ”§ Update Supabase redirect allow list
4. âœ… Verify Supabase dashboard has correct Google OAuth credentials (COMPLETED)
5. ðŸ§ª Test OAuth flow end-to-end after Site URL fix
6. ðŸ§¹ Remove debugging code from callback route

## Production Domains to Include
- `https://bookedbarber.com` (PRIMARY - must match Site URL)
- `https://www.bookedbarber.com`
- `https://6fb-ai-dashboard-*.vercel.app` (staging/development)
- `http://localhost:9999` (development only)
