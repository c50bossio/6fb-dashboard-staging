ADDITIONAL TECHNICAL DETAILS FOR CIN7 SUPPORT TICKET #220609

Account Details:
- Account ID: 1fd319f3-0a8b-4314-bb82-603f47fe20e9
- API Key (last 4 digits): ...5743
- API Key was freshly regenerated today and external API access is confirmed enabled

Critical Issue Discovered:
The external API endpoint (https://inventory.dearsystems.com/ExternalApi/) is returning "Incorrect credentials!" for ALL requests, regardless of the credentials provided.

Evidence:
1. Valid API credentials return: "Incorrect credentials!" (403 error)
2. Invalid/fake credentials return: "Incorrect credentials!" (403 error)
3. No credentials return: "Incorrect credentials!" (403 error)

This proves the API is not validating credentials at all - it's returning a generic error for every request.

Test Results:
- Tested endpoints: /ExternalApi/Me, /ExternalAPI/v2/me, /externalapi/products
- All return the same 403 "Incorrect credentials!" error
- Even completely wrong account IDs return the same error
- The API Explorer works (using browser session cookies), but external API calls don't work

What Works vs What Doesn't:
✅ WORKS: API Explorer (uses browser session authentication after login)
❌ FAILS: External API calls using api-auth-accountid and api-auth-applicationkey headers

Timeline:
- This integration was working yesterday (August 16, 2025)
- Started failing today (August 17, 2025) with no code changes on our side
- Multiple API key regenerations have not resolved the issue

Technical Tests Performed:
1. Standard authentication headers (api-auth-accountid, api-auth-applicationkey)
2. Various URL formats (/ExternalApi/, /ExternalAPI/v2/, /externalapi/)
3. Different HTTP clients (fetch, axios, curl, Node.js https)
4. Browser-based requests via Playwright
5. All authentication header variations documented in CIN7 API docs

Request for CIN7 Support:
1. Please verify the external API service is functioning correctly
2. Check if there were any changes to the API authentication system between Aug 16-17
3. Confirm our account has proper external API access permissions
4. Test the external API endpoint from your side with our account
5. Check for any IP restrictions or rate limiting affecting our account

This is blocking our production integration which was working yesterday. We have over $500,000 in inventory that needs to be synced.

Thank you for your urgent attention to this matter.
